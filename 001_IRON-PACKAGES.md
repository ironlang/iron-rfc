## Motivation

## Details

## Defining a package

The _package_ is the highest level of abstraction in Iron software systems. They are created using Forge:

```sh
# Create a new Iron package
forge init <package-name>
```

An Iron package contains one or many _modules_ that are versioned and distributed together via Git.
